# TheIndieTalesJam2021
Repo for the [TheIndieTales2021](https://itch.io/jam/indie-tales-jam) game jam and it's theme was _*One Room*_ with the restriction of drawing your own art.

Locked-In is a point-and-click puzzle where your wife accidentally took the apartment key and you're left looking for the spare.
 
The game can be played at itch.io: https://thespypuppet.itch.io/lockedin
